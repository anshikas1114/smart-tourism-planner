Smart Tourism Planner 🌏

Theme: Virasat se Vikas Tak

📌 Project Overview

The Smart Tourism Planner is a web-based application designed to promote Indian cultural and heritage tourism through modern technology. The project helps users plan culturally rich and budget-friendly trips by providing optimized travel routes, heritage site information, local food recommendations, and festival details for selected cities. The system demonstrates how traditional tourism (Virasat) can be transformed into a smart, digital, and accessible experience (Vikas).
